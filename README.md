# Scroll Memorize

A single-page tool that helps you memorize passages by revealing text as you scroll down the page. Paste any text into the editor, adjust the virtual scroll length, and move down the page to expose more of the passage while keeping the rest hidden.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in any modern browser. No build step or server is required. The page loads with sample text so you can immediately try the scrolling behaviour.

* Use the textarea to enter the content you want to memorize.
* Drag the range slider or type into the number field to control the scroll length. Select **Use automatic length** to return to the recommended value.
* Scroll down the page to gradually reveal the passage. The counter below the preview shows how many words are currently visible.
